- previous file: `infrastructure/controllers/local-path/local-path-provider.yaml`
- now changed to: `infrastructure/controllers/local-path/kustomization.yaml`
- reasoning:
  - instead of copy-pasting a large YAML file to get a resource, I just add their URL as the value of 'resources:' field in a `kustomization.yaml`
  - I use that resource as a *Template*, then use kustomize to apply changes to it 
  - .i.e converting a 'base' configuration into a production-specific one
- advantages:
  - avoiding adding unnecessary code & verbosity to the project
  - leveraging kustomize and FluxCD (GitOps) workflow
   - In less than 10 lines of code, I'm able to get the desired resource and personalize it.
