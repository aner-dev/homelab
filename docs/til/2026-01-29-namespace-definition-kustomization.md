- Previously: Having `namespace: <name>` in `base/` directory of applications
- Now: Moved `namespace: <name>` definition to `production/` directory 
- Reasoning:
- base/ should be a "Reusable Component." 
- Disadvantages of hardcoding `namespace: <name>` in `base/`:
  - Lack of Flexibility:
    - I cannot deploy a "test" version of the same app in a different namespace (like storage-test) because the base will always force it back to storage.
  - Kustomize Conflict:
    - If `base/` says `namespace: storage` and the `production/kustomization.yaml` says `namespace: prod-storage`, Kustomize will try to "overwrite" it, but it can lead to confusion and errors in complex setups.
- Advantages of Kustomization on `namespace` definition:
  - It adds namespace: storage to the StatefulSet.
  - It adds namespace: storage to the Service.
  - It automatically updates the Service name in your Ingress to point to the correct namespace.
- It acts as a *"Global Variable"* for that folder.
# Exceptions cases 
- There are a few cases where I might keep the namespace definition in `base/`:
  - Cluster-Wide Operators:
    - If an app must run in kube-system or it will break, I might hardcode it.
  - Strict Ownership: 
    - If the application "owns" that namespace and it will never, ever exist anywhere else.
